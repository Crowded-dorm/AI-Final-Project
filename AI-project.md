Video synthesis with near-duplicate images
---
- An app selecting and merging near-duplicate images.
### Strategies
We can make a program that provides several functionalities:
- Generating mid frames among near-duplicate images
- Apply motion sculpture algorithm
- Output gif

#### Codebase
1. Generating videos
    - https://github.com/google-research/frame-interpolation
2. Deformable sprites
    - https://github.com/vye16/deformable-sprites
